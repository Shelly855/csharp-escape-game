# C# GUI Escape Game (Completed on 10/12/23)

A simple escape-the-room game built with C# and Windows Forms in Visual Studio 2019, focusing on fundamental C# skills.

## Gameplay
The player explores different locations, collects items, solves puzzles, and eventually escapes the room.

## Features
- Basic Loops
- Operators
- If-Else Statements
- Classes
- Listboxes
- Reading from a File

## Note
My first C# projectâ€”I can't bear to look at it now, but hey, I hope it shows Iâ€™ve got the basics down... ðŸ˜…

## Possible Changes I Could Have Done
- Adding comments
- Improving the user interface (e.g., using a drop-down list instead of having the user enter their choice)
- Using a foreach loop instead of a for loop to display lists
- Adding more file handling
- Refactoring code (e.g., creating a function for initializing variables and setting their properties)
